# Portfolio Website -- Version Two

This is my second portfolio website, built with Nuxt & Vue (and other awesome libraries listed below). It recorded my web development journey working as a full-time web developer from 2021 to 2022.

I had a lot of fun in building this web portfolio, as I have learnt a lot of new skills in creating different animations and interaction, like page transition, text-rotating effect, parallax effect and image-reveal which moves with the cursor. This is also my first time diving deeper into Nuxt and locomotive (so my code may not be the best). Although sometimes I would stuck for hours in trying to make things work, it was satisfying once the desired effect is made, like my baby is finally born lol.

I hope you also enjoy viewing my portfolio, and thank you for checking this out. :partying_face:
